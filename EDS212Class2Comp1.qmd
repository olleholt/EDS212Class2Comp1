## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx = expression(3.1 * (x ^ 4) - 28 * x)

# This is storing the derivative expression
df_dx <- D(fx,'x')
#This will show me the derivative expression
df_dx

x<-10
#this function will return the slope of the function at the given x
eval(df_dx)
```

## Practice

Find the slope of g(z) = 2z^3^ - 10.5z\^2 +4.1 at z = 3.6

```{r}
gz = expression(2*(z^3) - 10.5*(z ^ 2) + 4.1)

# This is storing the derivative expression
dg_dz <- D(gz,'z')
#This will show me the derivative expression
dg_dz

z<-3.6
#this function will return the slope of the function at the given x
eval(dg_dz)
```

Now lets try to find the slope at a sequence of values

```{r}
gt = expression(2*(t^3) - 10.5*(t ^ 2) + 4.1)

# This is storing the derivative expression
dg_dt <- D(gt,'t')
#This will show me the derivative expression
dg_dt

t<-seq(from=1,to=3,length=20)
#this function will return the slope of the function at the given x
eval(dg_dt)
```
